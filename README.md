# TPTOS
An operating system for the R216K2A Computer.

Features:
  - simple command line
  - terminal driver for the RTERM P2
  - a better keyboard driver for a more stable keyboard (the last keyboard had some issues)

Upcoming features:
  - Fat12 file system (or any other file system)
  - more commands
  - hopefully speed optimizations because it's painfully slow as of now (but there's not much to optimize)
